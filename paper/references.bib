	abstract = {NAMD is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems. NAMD scales to hundreds of processors on high-end parallel platforms, as well as tens of processors on low-cost commodity clusters, and also runs on individual desktop and laptop computers. NAMD works with AMBER and CHARMM potential functions, parameters, and file formats. This paper, directed to novices as well as experts, first introduces concepts and methods used in the NAMD program, describing the classical molecular dynamics force field, equations of motion, and integration methods along with the efficient electrostatics evaluation algorithms employed and temperature and pressure controls used. Features for steering the simulation across barriers and for calculating both alchemical and conformational free energy differences are presented. The motivations for and a roadmap to the internal design of NAMD, implemented in C++ and based on Charm++ parallel objects, are outlined. The factors affecting the serial and parallel performance of a simulation are discussed. Next, typical NAMD use is illustrated with representative applications to a small, a medium, and a large biomolecular system, highlighting particular features of NAMD, e.g., the Tcl scripting language. Finally, the paper provides a list of the key features of NAMD and discusses the benefits of combining NAMD with the molecular graphics/sequence analysis software VMD and the grid computing/collaboratory software BioCoRE. NAMD is distributed free of charge with source code at www.ks.uiuc.edu.},

	abstract = {The structural investigation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) requires ensemble models describing the diversity of the conformational states of the molecule. Due to their probabilistic nature, there is a need for new paradigms that understand and treat IDPs from a purely statistical point of view, considering their conformational ensembles as well-defined probability distributions. In this work, we define a conformational ensemble as an ordered set of probability distributions and provide a suitable metric to detect differences between two given ensembles at the residue level, both locally and globally. The underlying geometry of the conformational space is properly integrated, being one ensemble characterized by a set of probability distributions supported on the three-dimensional Euclidean space (for global-scale comparisons) and on the two-dimensional flat torus (for local-scale comparisons). The inherent uncertainty of the data is also taken into account to provide finer estimations of the differences between ensembles. Additionally, an overall distance between ensembles is defined from the differences at the residue level. We illustrate the interest of the approach with several examples of applications for the comparison of conformational ensembles: (i) produced from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using different force fields, and (ii) before and after refinement with experimental data. We also show the usefulness of the method to assess the convergence of MD simulations. The numerical tool has been implemented in Python through easy-to-use Jupyter Notebooks available at https://gitlab.laas.fr/moma/WASCO.},

We use metainference cryoelectron microscopy, an integrative structural biology approach, to determine an ensemble of conformations representing the structure and dynamics of a tau-microtubule complex comprising the entire microtubule-binding region of tau (residues 202–395). We thus identify the ground state of the complex and a series of excited states of lower populations. A comparison of the interactions in these different states reveals positions along the tau sequence that are important to determine the overall stability of the tau-microtubule complex. This analysis leads to the identification of positions where phosphorylation and acetylation events have destabilizing effects, which we validate by using site-specific post-translationally modified tau variants obtained by chemical mutagenesis. Taken together, these results illustrate how the simultaneous determination of ground and excited states of macromolecular complexes reveals functional and regulatory mechanisms.},

The phase behavior of IDPs is sequence dependent, and its investigation through molecular simulations requires protein models that combine computational efficiency with an accurate description of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions. We developed a general coarse-grained model of IDPs, with residue-level detail, based on an extensive set of experimental data on single-chain properties. Ensemble-averaged experimental observables are predicted from molecular simulations, and a data-driven parameter-learning procedure is used to identify the residue-specific model parameters that minimize the discrepancy between predictions and experiments. The model accurately reproduces the experimentally observed conformational propensities of a set of IDPs. Through two-body as well as large-scale molecular simulations, we show that the optimization of the intramolecular interactions results in improved predictions of protein self-association and LLPS.},

	abstract = {The microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau plays a key role in the regulation of microtubule assembly and spatial organization. Tau hyperphosphorylation affects its binding on the tubulin surface and has been shown to be involved in several pathologies such as Alzheimer’s disease. As the tau binding site on the microtubule lays close to the disordered and highly flexible tubulin C-terminal tails (CTTs), these are likely to impact the tau-tubulin interaction. Since the disordered tubulin CTTs are missing from the available experimental structures, we used homology modeling to build two complete models of tubulin heterotrimers with different isotypes for the β-tubulin subunit (βI/αI/βI and βIII/αI/βIII). We then performed long timescale classical Molecular Dynamics simulations for the tau-R2/tubulin assembly (in systems with and without CTTs) and analyzed the resulting trajectories to obtain a detailed view of the protein interface in the complex and the impact of the CTTs on the stability of this assembly. Additional analyses of the CTT mobility in the presence, or in the absence, of tau also highlight how tau might modulate the CTT activity as hooks that are involved in the recruitment of several MAPs. In particular, we observe a wrapping phenomenon, where the β-tubulin CTTs form a loop over tau-R2, thus stabilizing its interaction with the tubulin surface and simultaneously reducing the CTT availability for interactions with other MAPs.},

In addition, part of tau is actively released into extracellular space.Besides stabilizing microtubules, regulating their dynamic instability and supporting axonal transport, tau can interact with various cell components and thus serves other functions in various other processes, including neuronal activity, neurogenesis, iron export and long-term depression.Pathological tau may induce neurotoxicity owing to its loss of function, toxic gain of function or its mislocalization, which mediates amyloid-β-induced toxicity.Several tau- or microtubule-based therapeutic approaches have been proposed, including tau aggregation inhibitors, inhibitors of kinases targeting tau, inhibition of tau acetylation, stabilization of microtubules, reduction of tau by antisense oligonucleotides, and immunotherapy using antibodies against tau or phosphorylated tau.},

The advantage of using small structural prototypes such as PBs is to give a good approximation of the local structure of the protein backbone. More importantly, by reducing the conformational complexity of protein structures, PBs allow analysis of local protein deformability which cannot be done with other methods and had been used efficiently in different applications.

	abstract = {Tau is an intrinsically disordered (IDP) microtubule-associated protein (MAP) that plays a key part in microtubule assembly and organization. The function of tau can be regulated by multiple phosphorylation sites. These post-translational modifications are known to decrease the binding affinity of tau for microtubules, and abnormal tau phosphorylation patterns are involved in Alzheimer’s disease. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we compared the conformational landscapes explored by the tau R2 repeat domain (which comprises a strong tubulin binding site) in its native state and with multiple phosphorylations on the S285, S289, and S293 residues, with four different standard force field (FF)/water model combinations. We find that the different parameters used for the phosphate groups (which can be more or less flexible) in these FFs and the specific interactions between bulk cations and water lead to the formation of a specific type of counterion bridge, termed nP-collab (for nphosphate collaboration, with n being an integer), where counterions form stable structures binding with two or three phosphate groups simultaneously. The resulting effect of nP-collabs on the tau-R2 conformational space differs when using sodium or potassium cations and is likely to impact the peptide overall dynamics and how this MAP interacts with tubulins. We also investigated the effect of phosphoresidue spacing and ionic concentration by modeling polyalanine peptides containing two phosphoserines located one-six residues apart. Three new metrics specifically tailored for IDPs (proteic Menger curvature, local curvature, and local flexibility) were introduced, which allow us to fully characterize the impact of nP-collabs on the dynamics of disordered peptides at the residue level.},

	abstract = {By using an unsupervised cluster analyzer, we have identified a local structural alphabet composed of 16 folding patterns of five consecutive Cα (“protein blocks”). The dependence that exists between successive blocks is explicitly taken into account. A Bayesian approach based on the relation protein block-amino acid propensity is used for prediction and leads to a success rate close to 35\%. Sharing sequence windows associated with certain blocks into “sequence families” improves the prediction accuracy by 6\%. This prediction accuracy exceeds 75\% when keeping the first four predicted protein blocks at each site of the protein. In addition, two different strategies are proposed: the first one defines the number of protein blocks in each site needed for respecting a user-fixed prediction accuracy, and alternatively, the second one defines the different protein sites to be predicted with a user-fixed number of blocks and a chosen accuracy. This last strategy applied to the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (α/β protein) shows that 91\% of the sites may be predicted with a prediction accuracy larger than 77\% considering only three blocks per site. The prediction strategies proposed improve our knowledge about sequence-structure dependence and should be very useful in ab initio protein modelling.

	abstract = {Dimensionality reduction methods are usually applied on molecular dynamics simulations of macromolecules for analysis and visualization purpose. It is normally desired that suitable dimensionality reduction methods could clearly distinguish functionally important states with different conformations for the systems of interest. However, common dimensionality reduction methods for macromolecules simulations, including pre-defined order parameters and collective variables (CVs), principal component analysis (PCA), and time-structure based independent component analysis (t-ICA), only have limited success due to significant key structural information loss. Here, we introduced t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method as a dimensionality reduction method with minimum structural information loss widely used in bioinformatics for analyses of macromolecules, especially biomacromolecules simulations. It is demonstrated that both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) models of t-SNE method are superior to distinguish important functional states of a model allosteric protein system for free energy and mechanistic analysis. Projections of the model protein simulations onto 1D and 2D t-SNE surfaces provide both clear visual cues and quantitative information, which is not readily available using other methods, regarding to the transition mechanism between two important functional states of this protein.,},

While most popular molecular dynamics packages inevitably provide PCA tools to analyze protein trajectories, researchers often make inferences of their results without having insight into how to make interpretations, and they are often unaware of limitations and generalizations of such analysis. Here we review best practices for applying standard PCA, describe useful variants, discuss why one may wish to make comparison studies, and describe a set of metrics that make comparisons possible. In practice, one will be forced to make inferences about the essential dynamics of a protein without having the desired amount of samples. Therefore, considerable time is spent on describing how to judge the significance of results, highlighting pitfalls. The topic of PCA is reviewed from the perspective of many practical considerations, and useful recipes are provided.},

	abstract = {The reproducibility and transparency of scientific findings are widely recognized as crucial for promoting scientific progress. However, when it comes to scientific software, researchers face many barriers and few incentives to ensure that their software is open to the community, thoroughly tested, and easily accessible. To address this issue, the MDAKits framework has been developed, which simplifies the process of creating toolkits for the MDAnalysis simulation analysis package (https://www.mdanalysis.org/) that follow the basic principles of FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability). The MDAKit framework provides a cookiecutter template, best practices documentation, and a continually validated registry. Registered kits are continually tested against the latest release and development version of the MDAnalysis library and their code health is indicated with badges. Users can browse the registry frontend (https://mdakits.mdanalysis.org/) to find new packages, learn about associated publications, and assess the package health in order to make informed decisions about using a MDAKit in their own research. The criteria for registering an MDAKit (open source, version control, documentation, tests) are similar to the criteria required for publishing a paper in a software journal, so we encourage and support publication in, e.g., the Journal of Open Source Software, creating further academic incentive for researchers to publish code. Through the MDAKits framework, we aim to foster the creation of a diverse ecosystem of sustainable community-driven downstream tools for MDAnalysis and hope to provide a blueprint for a model for growing communities around other scientific packages.},

	abstract = {The phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated tau protein plays a key role in the regulation of its physiological function. In particular, tau hyperphosphorylation affects its binding on the tubulin surface, destabilizing the tau-microtubule interface and leading to the accumulation of fibrillar aggregates in the brain. In this work, we performed classical Molecular Dynamics simulations for the tau-R2/tubulin assembly with various phosphorylations states of serines 285, 289 and 293. We analyze the resulting trajectories to obtain a detailed view of the protein interface in the complex, and the impact of tau phosphorylations on the stability of this assembly, and on the tubulin disordered C-Terminal tails (CTTs) mobility. We show how the tubulin CTTs help maintaining the tau-R2 fragment on the tubulin surface despite the destabilizing effect induced by phosphorylations. Conversely, tau phosphorylation affects the CTTs flexibility and their potential activity as MAP recruiting hooks. Furthermore, counterion mediated bridges between the phosphate groups and tubulin glutamates also contribute to the binding of tau-R2 on the MT.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the effect of multiple phosphorylations of the Intrinsically Disordered Protein (IDP) tau on its hydrodynamic radius (Rh). Hyperphosphorylated tau is notably implicated in Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease The kinases responsible for adding phosphate groups are highly involved in the regulation of biological processes such as cell division, cell signalling, and apoptosis and, particularly, in the development of Alzheimer{\textquoteright}s disease, especially those recognized by the AT8 antibody. The main objective of this work is to understand how phosphorylation at the AT8 site affects the conformation and dynamics of the tau protein through the study of its hydrodynamic radius. To achieve this, we used a tau protein mutant with all phosphorylation sites mutated to alanine except those recognized by the AT8 antibody to achieve a specific phosphorylation pattern. The phosphorylation of this mutant was performed, firstly, by incubation with CDK2/ cyclin A kinase to obtain a first phosphorylated state, termed p-state 1 (serine at positions 202 and threonines at position 205 and 212 are phosphorylated), and secondly by incubation with CDK2/cyclin A kinase followed by GSK3β kinase to obtain a phosphorylated state termed call p-state 2 (serines 198 and 208 are phosphorylated in addition to the three previously described). The Rh of each sample was measured experimentally by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), and simulated using a new simulation model, pCALVADOS, combining the CALVADOS 2 model for IDPs with parameters for phosphorylated residues. We find that both wild-type tau and AT8-phosphorylated Tau mutants exhibit a relatively monodisperse distribution in solution suggesting that phosphorylations do not significantly alter the overall size of the conformational ensemble of tau. Our calculations of Local Curvatures and Local Flexibilities confirm that the mutations made on the tau sequence to perform selective phosphorylations do not significantly impact local dynamics, which is corroborated by several experimental results. We also identify a local stiffening and extension of the AT8 epitope that is proportional to the number of phosphorylations. Interestingly, phosphorylations do not just affect the immediate AT8 area. We also report contact losses at a distance, with a noticeable directionality pointing towards the N-terminal end of the monomer, which could have functional implications for the phosphorylated Tau protein. The study paves the way for future research on the structure-function relationship of Tau and the role of phosphorylation in neurodegenerative diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Intrinsic to these roles is the fact that unfolded proteins and flexible linkers sample many different conformations. Polymer models may capture this and complement experiments in elucidating the contributions of the unfolded state and flexible linkers. Here I review what can be predicted from these models and how well these predictions match experiments. For example, Gaussian chain models give quantitatively reasonable predictions of the effects of residual chargecharge interactions in the unfolded state and qualitatively reasonable results for the effects of spatial confinement and macromolecular crowding on protein stability. A wormlike chain model has met with success in quantifying the effects of flexible linkers in binding affinity enhancement and in regulatory switches. In future developments, more realistic models may emerge from molecular dynamics simulations, and these models will guide experiments to advance our understanding of the unfolded state and flexible linkers.},

Limited information about the native state of {IDPs} can be gained by the averaging over many heterogeneous molecules that is unavoidable in ensemble approaches. We used single molecule ﬂuorescence to characterize native state conformational dynamics in ﬁve synaptic proteins conﬁrmed to be disordered by other techniques. For three of the proteins, {SNAP}-25, synaptobrevin and complexin, their conformational dynamics could be described with a simple semiﬂexible polymer model. Surprisingly, two proteins, neuroligin and the {NMDAR}-2B glutamate receptor, were observed to stochastically switch among distinct conformational states despite the fact that they appeared intrinsically disordered by other measures. The hop-like intramolecular diffusion found in these proteins is suggested to deﬁne a class of functionality previously unrecognized for {IDPs}.},
